# es-theme-collections
Additionnal backgrounds for Emulation Station based on collections (Mario, Zelda, Kirby, Megaman, Castlevania)

You can copy these folders in an existing ES theme folder. Create custom collections in Emulation Station with the same name as the folder and ES will use the theme automatically in the main carroussel. 

These files will work as-is in the "Nostalgic" theme by Supermagicom (https://github.com/SuperMagicom/es-theme-nostalgic/). It could be adapted to any other theme but you would have to change the .xml file.
